# Projet Sparkify

## Installations
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- PySpark SQL
- PySpark ML

## Project Motivation
Capstone project for to predict the churn of music app Sparkify.

##The project involved:

- Loading and cleaning a small subset (128MB) of a full dataset available (12GB)
- Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and what features are useful for predicting churn
- Feature Engineering to create features that will be used in the modelling process
- Modelling using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Linear SVM, Naive Bayes
- File Descriptions
- There is one exploratory notebook and html file of the notebook available here to showcase my work in predicting churn. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

## Medium Blog Post
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@bhuiyan.mrahman01/project-sparkify-584e1ac333a0) explaining the technical details of my project. A Random Forest Classifier was chosen to be the best model by evaluating F1 score and accuracy metrics. The final model achieved an F1 and Accuracy score of 0.68 and 0.78 respectively.
